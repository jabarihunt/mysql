  "description": "A simple class that handles MySQL database instances with support for both TCP and Socket connections.  I created this class as a standard way to interact with MySQL databases from within other projects with very low overhead.  I will personally use it as a dependency in those projects, but it's perfectly capable of being used as a standalone handler.",
